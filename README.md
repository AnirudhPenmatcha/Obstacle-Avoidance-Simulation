# Obstacle-Avoidance-Simulation

Hello everyone, this is a project on simulating an algorithm to avoid obstacles for any automobile with a stereo camera attached in the front.
Specifically it is designed for the sake of the team I'm part of in my college. 

In order to run this you need to have the following dependencies installed (as of Feb 16, 2021) :
1. Python3
2. ROS Melodic (Python version)
3. Gazebo
