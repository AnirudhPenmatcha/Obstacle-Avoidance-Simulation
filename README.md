# Obstacle-Avoidance-Simulation

Hello everyone, this is a project on simulating (using Gazebo) an algorithm to avoid obstacles for any automobile with a stereo camera attached in the front.
Specifically it is designed to suit the needs of a Rover that I'm working on as a developer part of a team in my college. 

In order to run this you need to have the following dependencies installed (as of Feb 16, 2021) :
1. Python3
2. ROS Melodic (Python version)
3. Gazebo
